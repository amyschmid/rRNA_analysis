Busby, M.A.; Stewart, C.; Miller, C.A.; Grzeda, K.R.; Marth, G.T. Scotty: a web tool for designing RNA-Seq experiments to measure differential gene expression. Bioinformatics 2013, 29, 656-657, doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt015.

Yi Qiao, Director of Research & Science in Gabor Marth's lab, University of Utah, kindly provided the following instructions for accessing Scotty from a Linux machine:

Yi Qiao says:
"We have dockerized scotty and its dependencies into the image "qiaoy/marthlab.scotty" which is available on DockerHub. 
Suppose you have docker running on a local linux server, the following is all what is necessary to get scotty up and running again:

$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 qiaoy/marthlab.scotty

the -d option makes it run in daemon (detached) mode, and 
the -p 8080:80 binds port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host. 
If this is executed successfully, you should be able to open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and see the scotty web page. 
If you do this on a shared local server, you would of course need to replace 127.0.0.1 with the appropriate hostname, and make sure 
port 8080 is open on the firewall."
